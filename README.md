## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently employed in the semiconductor industry, working on plasma power generators
 
 ðŸŒ± At home, Iâ€™m learning how to dial in my 3D printer for maximum speed and acceleration (500 mm/s here we come!)
 
 ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a humidity/temperature sensor reference design that can be used in home-automation and modular horticulture
 
 âš¡ Fun fact:
I learned to code in my teens to get an edge in online games with trade bots and task-automation. My first programming language was C#, because there was a plugin available for the game I was into at the time (game: RotMG, plugin: KRelay). In 2017, I made my first online money selling max-tier RotMG items for $1 a pop, doing transactions stricly in BTC (when the price was around $2000). Too bad I didn't save any of that BTC!
